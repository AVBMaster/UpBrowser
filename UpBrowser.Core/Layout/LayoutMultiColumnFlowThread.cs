/// <summary>
/// Flow thread implementation for CSS multicol. This will be inserted as an
/// anonymous child block of the actual multicol container (i.e. the
/// LayoutBlockFlow whose style computes to non-auto column-count and/or
/// column-width). LayoutMultiColumnFlowThread is the heart of the multicol
/// implementation, and there is only one instance per multicol container. Child
/// content of the multicol container is parented into the flow thread at the
/// time of layoutObject insertion.
///
/// Apart from this flow thread child, the multicol container will also have
/// LayoutMultiColumnSet children, which are used to position the columns
/// visually. The flow thread is in charge of layout, and, after having
/// calculated the column width, it lays out content as if everything were in one
/// tall single column, except that there will typically be some amount of blank
/// space (also known as pagination struts) at the offsets where the actual
/// column boundaries are. This way, content that needs to be preceded by a break
/// will appear at the top of the next column. Content needs to be preceded by a
/// break when there's a forced break or when the content is unbreakable and
/// cannot fully fit in the same column as the preceding piece of content.
/// Although a LayoutMultiColumnFlowThread is laid out, it does not take up any
/// space in its container. It's the LayoutMultiColumnSet objects that take up
/// the necessary amount of space, and make sure that the columns are painted and
/// hit-tested correctly.
///
/// If there is any column content inside the multicol container, we create a
/// LayoutMultiColumnSet. We only need to create multiple sets if there are
/// spanners (column-span:all) in the multicol container. When a spanner is
/// inserted, content preceding it gets its own set, and content succeeding it
/// will get another set. The spanner itself will also get its own placeholder
/// between the sets (LayoutMultiColumnSpannerPlaceholder), so that it gets
/// positioned and sized correctly. The column-span:all element is inside the
/// flow thread, but its containing block is the multicol container.
///
/// Some invariants for the layout tree structure for multicol:
/// - A multicol container is always a LayoutBlockFlow
/// - Every multicol container has one and only one LayoutMultiColumnFlowThread
/// - All multicol DOM children and pseudo-elements associated with the multicol
///   container are reparented into the flow thread.
/// - The LayoutMultiColumnFlowThread is the first child of the multicol
///   container.
/// - A multicol container may only have LayoutMultiColumnFlowThread,
///   LayoutMultiColumnSet and LayoutMultiColumnSpannerPlaceholder children.
/// - A LayoutMultiColumnSet may not be adjacent to another LayoutMultiColumnSet;
///   there are no use-cases for it, and there are also implementation
///   limitations behind this requirement.
/// - The flow thread is not in the containing block chain for children that are
///   not to be laid out in columns. This means column spanners and absolutely
///   positioned children whose containing block is outside column content
/// - Each spanner (column-span:all) establishes a
///   LayoutMultiColumnSpannerPlaceholder
///
/// The width of the flow thread is the same as the column width. The width of a
/// column set is the same as the content box width of the multicol container; in
/// other words exactly enough to hold the number of columns to be used, stacked
/// horizontally, plus column gaps between them.
///
/// Since it's the first child of the multicol container, the flow thread is laid
/// out first, albeit in a slightly special way, since it's not to take up any
/// space in its ancestors. Afterwards, the column sets are laid out. Column sets
/// get their height from the columns that they hold. In single column-row
/// constrained height non-balancing cases without spanners this will simply be
/// the same as the content height of the multicol container itself. In most
/// other cases we'll have to calculate optimal column heights ourselves, though.
/// This process is referred to as column balancing, and then we infer the column
/// height from the height of the flow thread portion occupied by each set.
///
/// More on column balancing: the columns' height is unknown in the first layout
/// pass when balancing. This means that we cannot insert any implicit (soft /
/// unforced) breaks (and pagination struts) when laying out the contents of the
/// flow thread. We'll just lay out everything in tall single strip. After the
/// initial flow thread layout pass we can determine a tentative / minimal /
/// initial column height. This is calculated by simply dividing the flow
/// thread's height by the number of specified columns. In the layout pass that
/// follows, we can insert breaks (and pagination struts) at column boundaries,
/// since we now have a column height.
/// It may very easily turn out that the calculated height wasn't enough, though.
/// We'll notice this at end of layout. If we end up with too many columns (i.e.
/// columns overflowing the multicol container), it wasn't enough. In this case
/// we need to increase the column heights. We'll increase them by the lowest
/// amount of space that could possibly affect where the breaks occur. We'll
/// relayout (to find new break points and the new lowest amount of space
/// increase that could affect where they occur, in case we need another round)
/// until we've reached an acceptable height (where everything fits perfectly in
/// the number of columns that we have specified). The rule of thumb is that we
/// shouldn't have to perform more of such iterations than the number of columns
/// that we have.
///
/// For each layout iteration done for column balancing, the flow thread will
/// need a deep layout if column heights changed in the previous pass, since
/// column height changes may affect break points and pagination struts anywhere
/// in the tree, and currently no way exists to do this in a more optimized
/// manner.
///
/// There's also some documentation online:
/// https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-column-layout
